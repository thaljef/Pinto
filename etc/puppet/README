This is a puppet manifest useful for installing pinto 
on a node.  This is barely adapted from working code 
in the author's environment.  

To use it, install the module in your own 
    /etc/puppet/modules/$environment path 

Update the default administrative password as follows:

    htpasswd -c \
        pinto/files/etc/pinto/htpasswd.starter \
        admin

and enter your password when prompted.  

Repeat this command without the -c switch for each additional user 
you wish to set up passwords for.  

Add to your /etc/puppet/manifests/nodes.pp file:  

    node 'pinto-repo.example.com' { include pinto }
    node 'pinto-client.example.com' { include pinto }

Of course you should name these nodes whatever makes sense in your 
own network.  And if you understand pinto, you know you have much
flexibility in determining where exactly this pinto class should 
be included.    

If your pinto repository is hosted on a machine which is 
not identified by facter to puppet as having a hostname in 
the form:  /^pinto-repo.*/, you should update the manifest 
so that the pintod daemon is installed on the correct server.  

In this file:

    pinto/manifests/init.pp

Edit the line which reads:

    if $fqdn =~ /^pinto-repo.*/ {

to make sense in your environment.
