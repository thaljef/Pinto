=head1 SYNOPSIS

  pinto --root=REPOSITORY_ROOT install [OPTIONS] TARGET...

=head1 DESCRIPTION

!! THIS COMMAND IS EXPERIMENTAL !!

Installs targets from the repository into your environment.  This
is just a thin wrapper around L<cpanm> that is wired to fetch
everything from the Pinto repository, rather than a public CPAN
mirror.

If the C<--do-pull> option is given, then all targets and their 
prerequisites will be pulled onto the stack before attempting to 
install them.  If any thing cannot be pulled because it cannot be
found or is blocked by a pin, then the installation will not
proceed.

=head1 COMMAND ARGUMENTS

Arguments are the things you want to install.  These can be package
names, distribution paths, URIs, local files, or directories.  Look at
the L<cpanm> documentation to see all the different ways of specifying
what to install.

You can also pipe arguments to this command over STDIN.  In that case,
blank lines and lines that look like comments (i.e. starting with "#"
or ';') will be ignored.

=head1 COMMAND OPTIONS

=over 4

=item --cascade

!! THIS OPTION IS EXPERIMENTAL !!

When searching for a prerequisite package, always take the latest
satisfactory version of the package found amongst B<all> the upstream
repositories, rather than just taking the B<first> satisfactory version that
is found.  Remember that Pinto only searches the upstream repositories when
the local repository does not already contain a satisfactory version of the
package. This option only matters when the C<--do-pull> option is also used.

=item --cpanm-exe PATH

=item --cpanm PATH

Sets the path to the L<cpanm> executable.  If not specified, the
C<PATH> will be searched for the executable.  At present, cpanm
version 1.500 or newer is required.

=item --cpanm-options NAME=VALUE

=item -o NAME=VALUE

These are options that you wish to pass to L<cpanm>.  Do not prefix
the option NAME with a '-'.  You can pass any option you like, but the
C<--mirror> and C<--mirror-only> options will always be set to point
to the Pinto repository.

=item --diff-style=STYLE

Controls the style of the diff reports.  STYLE must be either C<concise> or
C<detailed>.  Concise reports show only one record for each distribution added
or deleted.  Detailed reports show one record for every package added or
deleted.  This option ony matters when the C<--do-pull> option is also used.

The default style is C<concise>.  However, the default style can changed by
setting the C<PINTO_DIFF_STYLE> environment variable to your preferred STYLE.
This variable affects the default style for diff reports generated by all
other commands too.

=item --do-pull

Pull the targets and recursively pull all their prerequisites onto the stack
before installing.  Without the C<--do-pull> option, all targets and their
prerequisites must already be on the stack or the installation will probably
fail.  When the C<--do-pull> option is used, the stack must not be locked.

=item --local-lib=DIRECTORY

=item -l DIRECTORY

Shortcut for setting the C<--local-lib> option on L<cpanm>.  Same as
C<--cpanm-options local-lib=DIRECTORY> or C<-o l=DIRECTORY>.

=item --local-lib-contained=DIRECTORY

=item -L DIRECTORY

Shortcut for setting the C<--local-lib-contained> option on L<cpanm>.
Same as C<--cpanm-options local-lib-containted=DIRECTORY> or C<-o
L=DIRECTORY>.

=item --message=TEXT

=item -m TEXT

Use TEXT as the revision history log message.  This is only relevant if you
also set the C<--do-pull> option.  If you do not use C<--message> option, then
you will be prompted to enter the message via your text editor.  Use the
C<PINTO_EDITOR> or C<EDITOR> or C<VISUAL> environment variables to control
which editor is used.  A log message is not required whenever the C<--dry-run>
option is set, or if the action did not yield any changes to the repository.

=item --stack=NAME

=item -s NAME

Use the stack with the given NAME as the repository index.  When
used with the C<--pull> option, this also determines which stack
prerequisites will be pulled onto. Defaults to the name of whichever
stack is currently marked as the default stack.  Use the
L<stacks|App::Pinto::Command::stacks> command to see the stacks in
the repository.

=item --use-default-message

=item -M

Use the default value for the revision history log message.  This is only
relevant if you also set the C<--do-pull> option. Pinto will generate a semi-
informative log message just based on the command and its arguments.  If you
set an explicit message with C<--message>, the C<--use- default-message>
option will be silently ignored.

=head1 USING cpan OR cpanm DIRECTLY

On the surface, A Pinto repository looks like an ordinary CPAN repository, so
you can use any client to install modules.  All you have to do is "point"  it
at the URI of your Pinto repository.  Each client has a slightly different
interface for setting the URI.

For L<cpanm>, use the C<--mirror> and C<--mirror-only> options like this:

  $> cpanm --mirror file:///path/to/repo --mirror-only Some::Package ...

For L<cpan>, set the C<urllist> config option via the shell like this:

  $> cpan
  cpan[1]> o conf urllist file:///path/to/repo
  cpan[2]> reload index
  cpan[3]> install Some::Package
  cpan[4]> o conf commit     # If you want to make the change permanent

Pointing your client at the top of your repository will install modules from
the default stack.  To install from a particular stack, just append the stack
name to the URI.  For example:

  file:///path/to/repo                # Install from default stack
  file:///path/to/repo/stacks/dev     # Install from "dev" stack
  file:///path/to/repo/stacks/prod    # Install from "prod" stack

If your repository does not have a default stack then you must specify the
full URI to one of the stacks as shown above.

=head1 COMPATIBILITY

The C<install> command does not support some of the newer features found in
version 1.6 (or later) of L<cpanm>, such as installing from a Git repository,
installing development releases, or using complex version  expressions. If you
pass any of those as arguments to this command, the behavior is unspecified.
