=head1 GOALS

Pinto has two primary goals.  First, Pinto seeks to address the
problem of instability in the CPAN mirrors.  Distribution archives are
constantly added and removed from the CPAN, so if you use it to build
a system or application, you may not get the same result twice.
Second, Pinto seeks to encourage developers to use the CPAN toolchain
for building, testing, and dependency management of their own local
software, even if they never plan to release it to the CPAN.

Pinto accomplishes these goals by providing tools for creating and
managing your own custom repositories of distribution archives.  These
repositories can contain any distribution archives you like, and can
be used with the standard CPAN toolchain.  The tools also support
various operations that enable you to deal with common problems that
arise during the development process.

=head1 PRIOR ART


Over the last few years, I personally used various combinations of
those modules to create custom repositories at several organizations.
But they always required some wrapping and/or glue to make them usable 
in the development process.  And none of them seemed to be designed for 
extension.

I wanted a tool that would work out-of-the-box, would accommodate a 
wide range of use cases, would scale to a large number of users, and 
could grow in unexpected directions.  And so, Pinto was born.

=head1 COMPONENTS

The Pinto suite consists of several components, which are all included
in this distribution.  For most use cases, you should treat Pinto as 
an external application rather than a library that is integrated with 
your own application code.  I strongly recommend reading 
L<Pinto::Manual::Installing> for tips on installing Pinto in the manner 
that is most appropriate for your needs.

=head2 L<pinto>

L<pinto> is a command line application for creating and managing a
Pinto repository.  It works transparently with both remote and
local repositories.  However, repositories can only be created
locally.

=head2 L<pintod>

L<pintod> provides a web service interface to your Pinto repository.
This allows multiple (possibly remote) developers to manage a central
repository.  L<pintod> also functions as the back end HTTP server for
installer clients like L<cpan>, L<cpanp>, and L<cpanm>.

=head2 L<Pinto> and L<Pinto::Remote>

L<Pinto> and L<Pinto::Remote> are the backend libraries for the L<pinto> 
application.  These are fairly stable, but not officially public and
not documented.  If you want to hack on Pinto's internals, or create
a new application around Pinto, you should start looking at these.

=head2 L<Pinto::Server>

L<Pinto::Server> is the backend library for the L<pintod> server
application.  It is still immature, and subject to radical change.
It is based on raw L<Plack>, so if you are brave you could wrap it
with various middlewares to do interesting things.

=head1 TERMINOLOGY

Some of the terminology related to the CPAN is overloaded, which can
lead to some confusion.  So I'll try to define some of the key terms
that I use throughout the documentation and the code.

=head2  Archive

An "archive" is the file that developers ship, which contains all
their application/library code, test cases, build scripts etc.
Conversely, the archive is the file that users must fetch to install
the application/library.  Sometimes I also refer to these as
"distributions".

=head2 Package

A "package" is something inside a distribution archive that provides
some unit of functionality.  In Perl, packages are declared with the
C<package> keyword.  Some folks call these "modules" but I try to
avoid that term because it is frequently misused.

=head2 Prerequisite

A "prerequisite" is a package that must be installed for the sake of
another distribution archive.  Sometimes I call these "dependencies".
Pinto does not currently distinguish between different flavors of
prerequisites, such as "build-time" or "run-time" prerequisites.

=head1 CONCEPTS

=head2 Stack

All CPAN-like repositories have an index which maps the latest version
of each package to the archive that contains it.  Usually, there is
only one such index.  But with Pinto, there can be many indexes.  Each
of these indexes is called a "stack".  This allows you to create
different stacks of dependencies within a single repository.  So you
could have a "development" stack and a "production" stack.  Whenever
you add a distribution or upgrade a prerequisite, it only affects
one stack.

=head2 Pin

Only one version of a package can exist within a stack.  So when you
upgrade a package on stack, the newer version replaces the older one.
But sometimes, you discover that a newer version of package is
incompatible with your application, and you want to stay with the
older version until you have an opportunity to fix the problem.  In
those situations, Pinto allows you to "pin" a particular version of a
package to the stack.  This prevents the package from being upgraded
(either directly or as a prerequisite for some other package).

=head1 WHY IS IT CALLED PINTO

Pinto is a name that I sometimes use for my son Wesley (as in "pinto
bean").  Daddy loves you, Wes!
