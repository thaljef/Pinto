Interface changes:

    The 'author' parameter is now entirely optional.  It
    defaults to your shell username, if we can figure that
    out.  If not, then an exception is thrown, and you'll
    have to set the 'author' parameter explicitly.

    pinto[1] now has --notag, --nocommit, and --noinit
    options.  All these can also be set in your configuration
    file.  See the pinto[1] documentation for details.

Other changes:

    The internals of Pinto have been substantially rewritten
    to improve performance and readability of the code.  The
    Pinto API is still considered alpha, and subject to change.

Interface Changes:

    A config file for pinto[1] is no longer mandatory. If you do not
    have one, then you'll have to specify all required parameters on
    the command line (this is usually just the '--local' and sometimes
    the '--author' options).  If you don't specify these, you'll get a
    really ugly stack trace from Moose.  I'll look into making these
    error messages prettier in a future release.  Thanks to b.jakubski
    for suggesting this change.

Bug Fixes:

    RT #70015: Can't create repository.  The 'create' command failed
    because the 02packages file could not be read.  This has now been
    remedied.
