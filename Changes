    * Bug Fixes:

    Pinto::TestLogger didn't end with a true value.  Thank you, CPAN
    Testers!

    * Internal Changes:

    Switched from IPC::Cmd to Proc::Reliable for running shell
    commands. IPC::Cmd seems to do funky things with STDIN
    and STDOUT that don't set well with CGI.

    You can specify an output filehandle or a buffer (as a scalar
    reference) where you want the output from Pinto::list() to
    go.

    The output from the List action contains the name, version,
    and location in each package, rather than just the name.  This
    was a regression in the last version.

    * Other Changes:

    pinto-server[1], pinto-client[1], and all the Pinto::Server::*
    modules have been pulled out into a separate distribtuion,
    which will be released to CPAN shortly.

    * Bug Fixes:

    Fixed our call to File::Copy::copy() to accommodate older versions
    which did not handle Path::Class objects properly.  Thank you,
    CPAN Testers!

    * Bug Fixes:

    Fixed test failures that I introduced by renaming some classes in
    the last release.

    * Interface changes:

    pinto[1] is now called pinto-admin[1].  It still has all the same
    options and arguments.  Likewise, App::Pinto is now
    App::Pinto::Admin.

    With pinto-admin, the "mirror" parameter is now called "source".
    This reflects the fact that your dists don't necessarily have to
    come from a CPAN mirror.  They just have to come from some place
    that conforms to the CPAN structure.  Do not confuse this with 
    the "mirror" command, which still does actually mirror the
    aforementioned "source".

    * Other changes:

    Revised documentation.

    Added some basic functional tests.

    Created pinto-server and pinto-client, for using Pinto across a
    nework. These are still very experimental.

    Once again, a lot of the internals have been rewritten.  But the
    guts of Pinto are all private (for now), so you shouldn't really
    care.

    * Interface changes:

    The 'author' parameter is now entirely optional.  It defaults to
    your shell username, if we can figure that out.  If not, then an
    exception is thrown, and you'll have to set the 'author' parameter
    explicitly.

    pinto[1] now has --notag, --nocommit, and --noinit options.  All
    these can also be set in your configuration file.  See the
    pinto[1] documentation for details.

    * Other changes:

    The internals of Pinto have been substantially rewritten to
    improve performance and readability of the code.  The Pinto API is
    still considered alpha, and subject to change.

>> 0.007     2011-08-04 08:04:27 America/Los_Angeles

    * Interface Changes:

    A config file for pinto[1] is no longer mandatory. If you do not
    have one, then you'll have to specify all required parameters on
    the command line (this is usually just the '--local' and sometimes
    the '--author' options).  If you don't specify these, you'll get a
    really ugly stack trace from Moose.  I'll look into making these
    error messages prettier in a future release.  Thanks to b.jakubski
    for suggesting this change.

    * Bug Fixes:

    RT #70015: Can't create repository.  The 'create' command failed
    because the 02packages file could not be read.  This has now been
    remedied.

    * Other Changes:
    
    Edited documenation for pinto[1]
     
>> 0.006     2011-08-04 00:52:22 America/Los_Angeles

    More documentation edits.  No code changes.

>> 0.005     2011-08-04 00:43:34 America/Los_Angeles

    Brought the documentation for pinto[1] up to date with the 
    actual API.

>> 0.004     2011-08-04 00:23:23 America/Los_Angeles

    Default log level is now 1 (info).

    pinto[1] now exits with status 0 if successful.

    Improved some log messages.

>> 0.003     2011-08-03 22:59:10 America/Los_Angeles

    Major overhaul of internals.  But the pinto[1] command line
    interface is mostly the same.

>> 0.002     2011-07-26 17:20:46 America/Los_Angeles

    Corrected default path to the Pinto configuration file.

    Expanded POD for pinto[1]
