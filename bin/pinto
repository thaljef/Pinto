=head1 SYNOPSIS

First, create a configuration file at F<~/.pinto/config.ini>:

  # Required for all operations
  local = /path/to/your/pinto/repository

  # Required only for the 'upgrade' action
  remote = http://some-cpan-mirror

Then, run some commands:

  # Create an empty repository
  $> pinto create

  # Add your own archive to the repository
  $> pinto add Foo-Bar-1.2.tar.gz

  # Fill your repository with latest packages from the remote mirror
  $> pinto upgrade

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<pinto> is a command line utility for managing a Pinto repository.
The repository can contain your own private archives of Perl packages,
and/or mirror archives from another repository (like
L<http://cpan.perl.org>).  You can also put patched versions of
mirrored archives in your repository.

You can then point L<cpan> or L<cpanm> to your Pinto repository and
build and install your private archives (and their dependencies).

=head1 GLOBAL OPTIONS

The following parameters can be set in your configuration file.  The
default location of this file is F<~/.pinto/config.ini>, or you can
set the C<PERL_PINTO> environment variable to point to an different
location.  You can also specify the path to the configuration file on
the command line with the C<--profile> option.

=item author

Your identity as a module author.  This could be your PAUSE ID, but it
doesn't have to be.  As long as it is just alpha-numeric characters.

=item local

The path to a directory where your repository will be kept.  This
parameter is required for all operations.  You must be able to
read and write to this directory.

=item loglevel

Controls the amount of noise to make.  Valid values are
(debug|info|warn).  The default value is 'info'.  NOTE: this is not
actually implemented yet.

=item nocleanup

If set to a true value, L<pinto> will not automatically clean up files
in your repository after each command.

=item remote

The URL of a repository that you would like to mirror.  This could
be a public CPAN mirror, or another Pinto repository.  This parameter
is required for the C<upgrade> operation.

=item store_class

The name of the class that will handle storage of your repository.
The default is L<Pinto::Store>, which basically stores your repository
on the local file system.  Alternatives like L<Pinto::Store::Svn>
and L<Pinto::Store::Git> allow you to store your repository inside
a revision control system.  See the documentation for each of those
modules for additional configuration settings.

=back

Almost all the global options can also be overridden on the
command line.  Say C<pinto -help> to display the global options
and a list of available commands.

=head1 COMMANDS

The following commands are available.  Say C<pinto help COMMAND>
to display a list of options available for C<COMMAND>.

=item add Some-Archive-1.2.tar.gz [Another-Archive-2.6.tar.gz ... ]

Adds the given archives to the Pinto repository.  Any packages
contained in those archives will override the mirrored packages with
the same name.  See the L<"RULES"> section for more information about
how locally added archives interact with mirrored ones.

=item clean

Deletes any archive in the repository that is not currently in
the master index.  This usually happens automatically, unless
you've set the C<nocleanup> flag.

=item create

Creates a new, empty repository at the configured location.  You'll
get a warning if a repository already exists at that location.

=item list

Lists the curent packages and archives that are in the master index of
your repository.  This is basically just the contents of the
F<02packages.details.txt> file.

=item remove Some::Package [Another::Package ... ]

Removes the local archive that contains the given packages.  All other
packages that were contained in the same archive are also removed.
After removing a package, you will usually want to run C<upgrade> to
pull in any archives that might have been blocked by your local ones.

=item upgrade

Fills your repository with the archives that contain the latest
version of all packages on your remote mirror.  See the L<"RULES">
section for more information about how locally added archives interact
with mirrored ones.

=item verify

Reports any archives that are present in your repository but not
listed in the master index.  This is usually a sign that something
has gone wrong.

=back

=head1 RULES

There are certain rules that govern how the indexes are managed.
These rules are intended to ensure that folks pulling packages
from your repository will always get the *right  Also,
the rules attempt to make Pinto behave somewhat like PAUSE does.

=over 4

=item A local package always masks a mirrored package, and all other
packages that are in the same archive with the mirrored package.

This rule is key, so pay attention.  If the CPAN mirror has an archive
that contains both C<Foo> and C<Bar> packages, and you add your own
archive that contains C<Foo> package, then both the C<Foo> and C<Bar>
mirroed packages will be removed from your index.  This ensures that
anyone pulling packages from your repository will always get *your*
C<Foo>.  But they'll never be able to get C<Bar>.

If this rule were not in place, someone could pull C<Bar> from the
repository, which would overwrite the version of C<Foo> that you
wanted them to have.  This situation is probably rare, but it can
happen if you add a locally patched version of a mirrored archive, but
the mirrored archive later includes additional packages.

=item You can never add an archive with the same name twice.

Most archive-building tools will put some kind of version number in
the name of the archive, so this is rarely a problem.

=item Only the original author of a local package can add a newer
version of it.

Ownership is given on a first-come basis, just like PAUSE.  So if
C<SALLY> is the first author to add local package C<Foo::Bar> to the
repository, then only C<SALLY> can ever add that package again.

=item Only the original author of a local package can remove it.

Just like when adding new versions of a local package, only the
original author can remove it.
