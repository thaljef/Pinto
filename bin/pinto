=head1 SYNOPSIS

  pinto --root=REPOSITORY_ROOT [global options] COMMAND [command options] [args]


=head1 DESCRIPTION

pinto is a tool for creating and managing a custom CPAN-like
repository of Perl modules.  The purpose of such a repository is to
provide a stable, curated stack of dependencies from which you can
reliably build, test, and deploy your application using the standard
Perl tool chain.  pinto provides various commands for gathering and
managing distribution dependencies within the repository, so that you
can control precisely which dependencies go into your application.


=head1 COMMANDS

pinto supports several commands that perform various operations on
your repository, or report information about your repository.  To get
a listing of all the available commands:

  $> pinto commands

Each command has its own options and arguments.  To get a brief
summary:

  $> pinto help COMMAND

To see the complete manual for a command:

  $> pinto manual COMMAND


=head1 GLOBAL OPTIONS

The following options are available for all commands.

=over 4

=item  --root DIRECTORY | URL

=item  -r DIRECTORY | URL

Specifies the root of your repository.  This is mandatory for (almost)
all commands unless you've set the C<PINTO_REPOSITORY_ROOT>
environment variable to point to your repository.  The root can be a
path to a local directory, or the URL where a L<pintod> server is
listening.

=item --no-color

=item --no-colour

Do not colorize command output.

=item --password PASS

=item -p PASS

The password to use for server authentication.  This is only relevant
if using a remote repository.  If the PASS is "-" then you will
be prompted for a password.

=item --quiet

=item -q

Report only fatal errors.  This option silently overrides the
C<--verbose> options.  Also suppresses the progress meter.

Note: The progress meter is always suppressed when using a remote 
repository.  This will hopefully be fixed a future release.


=item --username NAME

=item -u NAME

The username to user for server authentication.  This is only relevant
if using a remote repository.  Defaults to your current login.

=item --verbose

=item -v

Display more diagnostic messages.  This switch can be repeated multiple
times for greater effect.  Diagnostic messages are always sent to STDERR.

=back

=head1 CONFIGURATION

Each repository has a configuration file that lives inside the repostiory
at F<.pinto/config/pinto.ini>.  This file is generated for you with default
values when you create the repository.  You can influence the initial value
for some of the properties when you run the L<init|App::Pinto::Command::init>
command.  Thereafter, you can change these properties by editing the
configuraiton file directly.

The following configuration parameters are supported:

=over 4

=item sources = URL1 [URL2 URL3 ...]

This is a space-delimited list of the URLs for the upstream repositories that 
this repository will pull archives from.  These can point to CPAN mirrors,
minicpan mirrors, or stacks within other Pinto repositories.  Pinto will search 
the source repositories in the order they are listed here.  The default value 
is C<http://cpan.perl.org http://backpan.perl.org>.

=item target_perl_version = X.X.X

Sets the default C<target_perl_version> property for all new stacks.
Otherwise, all new stacks will target the version of perl that you first used
to create the repository.  You can always configure the target perl for each
stack independently by using the L<props|App::Pinto::Command::props> command.

=item intermingle = 1 | 0

If true, stacks will be allowed to "intermingle" distributions that have
partially overlapping packages.  This makes pinto behave like PAUSE which
allows a package to remain in the index until it is replaced by a distribution
containing the same package.  Thus, it becomes possible to have an index that
contains just C<some> of the packages in a particular distribution.  This
typically occurrs when a package in a prior release is absent from a
subsequent release.  The default is false.

=back

B<BEWARE:> The above configuration properties are global -- they affect every
stack in the repository.  They also have a major affect on how the repository
behaves.  For these reasons, it is generally unwise to change these parameters 
once you have established the repository and filled it with content.  If you
do change them, be sure and notify your team about it.  Each stack also has 
some stack-specific configuration properties.  Those can be shown or set using 
the L<props|App::Pinto::Command::props> command.


=head1 ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

The following environment variables influence the behavior of pinto.  If you
have installed pinto as a stand-alone application as described in
L<Pinto::Manual::Installing>, then the best place to set these variables
is in your F<~/.pintorc> file.

=over 4

=item C<PINTO_REPOSITORY_ROOT>

Sets the default path or URL of the pinto repository, if the C<--root>
is not specified.  The C<--root> is required for almost all commands.
So if you usually only work with one repository, then setting this
can save you quite a bit of typing.

=item C<PINTO_EDITOR>

Sets the path to editor application that will be used to compose log
messages.  If not set, defaults to C<VISUAL> or C<EDITOR>.  If none
of those are set, either C<nano>, C<pico>, or C<vi> will be used (in 
that order).

=item C<PINTO_NO_COLOR>

=item C<PINTO_NO_COLOUR>

If set to a true value, suppresses color in all command output.

=item C<PINTO_COLORS>

=item C<PINTO_COLOURS>

A comma-separated list of exactly three color names.  Any name supported 
by L<Term::ANSIColor> is allowed.  These will be the colors that pinto 
uses to colorize various output.  For example:

  PINTO_COLORS='red, light blue, green on_white'

Listing too many or too few colors will cause an exception, as will using 
an invalid color name.

=item C<PINTO_USERNAME>

Sets the default username when C<--username> is not specified.  This is only 
used for authentication with a L<pintod> server.  Defaults to your current
shell username.

=item C<PINTO_AUTHOR_ID>

Sets the default author identity when the C<--author> option is not specified
(currently, only used by the L<add|App::Pinto::Commmand::add> command).  Defaults 
to your current shell username.  By PAUSE convention, all author id's are forced 
to uppercase.

=item C<PINTO_PAGER>

Sets the path to the pager application that will be used to paginate output from
each command.  Defaults to C<PAGER>.  If none of these are set, then no pager 
is used.

=item C<PINTO_DIFF_STYLE>

Sets the default style for diff reports.  Valid styles are C<detailed> and
C<concise>.  The default is C<concise>.  For commands that produce diff reports,
this can be overriden with the C<--diff-style> option.

=item C<PINTO_DEBUG>

If set to 1, pinto will emit more diagnostic messages to STDERR.  If set to 2, 
pinto will emit even more diagnostic messages.
