This is a GnuPG home directory containing a keyring and trustdb suitable for
testing the verify command. The keyring contains 2 keys, one with 'ultimate
trusted' and the other untrusted.  Both keys have empty passphrases to
simplify testing.  Hopefully it goes without saying: don't use these keys for
anything but tetsting.
